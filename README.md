Reactivate Theme
===================

WordPress plugin that can reactivate the current theme.

Useful primarily for helping with development, the plugin will allow you to swiftly trigger code that is hooked into the 'after_switch_theme' and 'switch_theme' actions. Before, you had to switch to an alternative theme and back to the original, now you only need to find Tools > Reactivate Theme.
